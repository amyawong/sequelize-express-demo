1. In Terminal:
        npm init -y
        npm i express
        npm i sequelize
        npm i pg

2. To set up Sequelize (set up from frontend to backend because it allows us to figure out what our DB needs and doesn't need to have):
    (setting up from back to front makes it so that we have to create mock data (fake data that's not in the database))
        Go into db.js
